# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/NEA0Fr7muHfukl5lziVAhg), **without the help of Google:**

## General
- How to create tables with constraints
- How to optimize queries by adding indexes
- What is and how to implement stored procedures and functions in MySQL
- What is and how to implement views in MySQL
- What is and how to implement triggers in MySQL

# Requirements

##General
- All your files will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `MySQL 5.7` (version `5.7.30`)
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your SQL queries should have a comment just before (i.e. syntax above)
- All your files should start by a comment describing the task
- All SQL keywords should be in uppercase (`SELECT`, `WHERE`…)
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

# More Info

**Comments for your SQL file:**

```bash
$ cat my_script.sql
-- 3 first students in the Batch ID=3
-- because Batch 3 is the best!
SELECT id, name FROM students WHERE batch_id = 3 ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 3;
$
```

**Use “container-on-demand” to run MySQL**

- Ask for container `Ubuntu 18.04 - Python 3.7`
- Connect via SSH
- Or via the WebTerminal
- In the container, you should start MySQL before playing with it:

```bash
$ service mysql start
 * MySQL Community Server 5.7.30 is started
$
$ cat 0-list_databases.sql | mysql -uroot -p my_database
Enter password:
Database
information_schema
mysql
performance_schema
sys
$
```

**In the container, credentials are `root/root`**

## How to import a SQL dump

```bash
$ echo "CREATE DATABASE hbtn_0d_tvshows;" | mysql -uroot -p
Enter password:
$ curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-higher-level_programming+/274/hbtn_0d_tvshows.sql" -s | mysql -uroot -p hbtn_0d_tvshows
Enter password:
$ echo "SELECT * FROM tv_genres" | mysql -uroot -p hbtn_0d_tvshows
Enter password:
id  name
1   Drama
2   Mystery
3   Adventure
4   Fantasy
5   Comedy
6   Crime
7   Suspense
8   Thriller
$
```
